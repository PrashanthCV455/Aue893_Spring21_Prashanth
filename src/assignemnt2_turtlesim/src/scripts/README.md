 FOR problem 1 to move in a circle I modified the code for moving in a straight line by adding angular velocity in z direction
Then once I run the code, I input the distance as 4 and speed as 1, the turtle traces a circle.


FOR problem 2 to trace a sqaure, I combined the code for moving in a straight line and rotate and ran it as demonstrated in the screenshot and video

Problem 3 I figured out that an if statement would be required where the goal_pose will keep changing as the destination is reached, there would be nested if loop which would involve the rotate or steering angle but I couldnt get past a class definition error where the error states please define self, self not defined. I have attached the failed code goto.py for closed loop sqaure.
